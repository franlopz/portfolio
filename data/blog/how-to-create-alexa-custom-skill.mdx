# How to create a custom Alexa skill with Node.js

## What is Alexa?

Alexa is a cloud-based voice service developed by amazon, it runs on Amazon devices, and third-party device manufacturers.
It recognizes spoken commands in more than 10 languages to perform pre-defined actions and custom skills.

Alexa is commonly found on Amazon devices like Amazon Echo but also runs on TVs, cars, third-party speakers, and in any
smartphone with the Amazon Alexa app.

## Alexa skills

Alexa has features that are installed by default, you can extend those with skills, that are like apps that provide
new actions, content and services. Skills let users perform tasks like listening to music, checking the news, or playing
a game. There are more than 100,000 skills available to install,

To create an Alexa Skill:

### Signup or login

Go to [Alexa Developer Console](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/console/ask) and log in with your amazon account, if you do not have one, create one.

### Create a skill

You will see the main screen where it will list your skills. Click Create skill button.

#### Naming and initial setup

There are four fields to modify/select:

1. Name: Avoid brand names if you are not the owner or have the right to use them.
2. Primary locale: It refers to the language in which the skill will work.

   />

3. Choose a model: To customize the skill's interactions choose the `Custom` option.
4. Choose a method to host the backend: The easiest way to create the skill is with Alexa-hosted options (Node.js or Phyton),
   if you prefer you can provision your own endpoint, you can use Node.js, Java, Python, C#, Go, Ruby, or PowerShell to create the
   Lambda function.

   />

#### Designing the Interface

The interface configuration is where to specify the words to trigger
the intents of skill service. It is responsible for processing the user's spoken
words. It identifies which service can handle that request by triggering
the right skill.

In the above illustration is shown a statement to invoke a skill, Alexa
identifies the skill's name, analyzes and understands the request, it
considers a variety of defined utterances to launch the intent handler. The
intent handler returns a response and it returns a spoken and/or visual response.

1. Skill invocation name: It must have at least 2 words, avoid branded names if you
   do not have the rights to use them.

2. Intents: Representation of an action that fulfills a request. Intents can have arguments called slots.
   2.1 Go to Interaction model > Intents and click on `+ Add Intent`.
   2.2 Select `Create custom intent`, type a name for the intent and click on Create custom intent.
   2.3 The new intent is shown to add sample utterances, this is to invoke the intent. Sample utterances
   can consist of only unicode characters, spaces, periods for abbreviations, underscores, possessive
   apostrophes, curly braces, and hyphens. The variables (slots) are inside curly braces.

   />
   2.4 If an utterance has a slot, the section Intent Slot will be updated with the
   slot name to select the slot type. If you do not have any slot type, go to numeral
   `3`.

   />

3. Go to `Assets > Slot Types` and click on `Add Slot Type`.
   3.1 Select `Create a custom slot type with values` and type a name for the slot type.
   The name of a custom slot type must begin and end with an alphabetic character and can
   consist only of alphabetic characters or underscores
   3.2 It will be shown a screen to add slot values to the slot type created.

4. Click on Save Model and then on Build Model. You will be notified when the building process
   ends.

#### Skill service

Amazon Alexa is based on the Amazon Web Service, the easiest way to build
a custom skill is to use AWS Lambda, a serverless, event-driven computer service,
that automatically manages computer resources. You can use Alexa-hosted Skills
to build your Lambda function in the Alexa developer console, or, you can store your
code and resources yourself. In the next steps, we are going to use the Alexa developer console.

In Alexa Developer Console, click the **Code** tab. It will have a sample code handling
intents using the Alexa Skills Kit SDK.

The entry point of the AWS Lambda function is the Lambda handler, the following code creates
a Lambda handler function to route all inbound requests to your skill.

The **ASK SDK v2** for Node.js provides a lambda builder function to
construct the Lambda handler function that invokes the skill instance
and returns the response.

#### Request Handlers

Request handlers are responsible for handling requests, it's an object
which has two methods:

- **canHandle**: is called when there is an incoming request,
  to determine if the request handler can process it.
  It must return _true_ if the handler can handle the request
  or _false_ if cannot. This method is called on in the order that
  each request handler is registered. The SDK will choose the first
  handler capable of handling the request.

    width="326"
    height="220"
    alt="can handle"
  />
- **handle**: is called if canHandle returns _true_, it contains
  the processing logic accepts HandlerInput and returns a Response or
  Promise\<Response\>.

    width="337"
    height="220"

  />
  The *responseBuilder* from HandlerInput container object includes several methods
  to build the response, the detailed description of *responseBuilder* can be found
  on this [link](http://ask-sdk-node-typedoc.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/classes/responsebuilder.html).

When you finished, click on **Save** and then on **Deploy** button, when the process ends, you can click in
**Test** tab and test it by using you interface that you just created.
