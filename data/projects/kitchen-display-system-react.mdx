## Introduction

Web application built with React that improves productivity in restaurants' kitchens by using a digitalized and modern way to receive, prepare and mark orders as done. It simplifies back-of-house operations. Kitchen staff can manage incoming orders with real-time notifications and time alerts. It replaces printers and paper tickets in the kitchen.

## Deployed application

- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/franlopz/kitchen-display)

## Motivation to develop this application

I was working in a restaurant for a few years, it operates with a POS which can be customized to build a kitchen display system, it works fine the most of time but I identified some problems/improvements:

- Depending on the screen size, only a couple of orders can be shown.
- It freezes for a couple of seconds at marking the order as done.
- It can run on a windows computer only.
- The kitchen display needs a server that is a pc running on the local network.
- It doesnâ€™t have sound alerts.
- Modifying the layout is complex because many inputs need to be updated.
- It crashes if the server is offline.

## Requirements

I talked to kitchen staff to figure out their needs when an order is received, they needed a quick and organized process, without screen freezes, visual and sound alerts, automatic reconnection if the network fails and a summary feature.

### Functional requirements

- The system must allow login with an email and password.
- An account can have multiple users with a unique pin code to see the orders screen.
- When an order is received it should notify with a sound alert.
- When an order is updated the change must be shown on the screen immediately.
- The system must be accessed with any device and everywhere.
- The system must have an easy way to update the layout and settings.
- The system must have real-time communication.
- The system must notify if the connection is down and try reconnection.
- The system must have an order summary.
