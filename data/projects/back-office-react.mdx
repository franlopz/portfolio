This is a backoffice application that was initially thought of for the restaurant I was working at. I identified repetitive and tedious management processes that could be simplified with an application.

The POS works in a local network, the data remains in the computer it cannot be checked when the computer is off or outside the local network.

The local government updated the platform to file taxes, it requires uploading `.csv` files with a specific format, because of the line of business, the application was required to export only files for a single tax form.

The main needs were:

Upload sales from POS to an online database.
Store purchases online since the POS used has no that feature.
Get online reports.
Export data and filter by date range.
Login by email.
Multi-users.
